You'll need to answer 141 queries about where we should hold our party.
For each query, please respond with the index of the city where the party should be held and the sum total travel time for everyone to get there (two space-separated integers). Please find the location that minimizes the total travel time for everyone. Note that the total travel time will be less than 10^18.
In this scenario, there are 6 cities, 10 bidirectional roads between them, and 3 people that are coming.
Here are where all the people are:
There is a person at city 0
There is a person at city 3
There is a person at city 5
Every person also needs to pick up food from exactly one city on the way to the party. Here is a list of where all of the good food is:
There is good food at city 1
There is good food at city 3
There is good food at city 2
Now, I'll tell you about the start city, end city, and travel time for each road.
There is a road that goes from 0 to 1 and takes 907 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 0 to 2 and takes 896 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 0 to 3 and takes 699 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 0 to 4 and takes 376 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 1 to 3 and takes 782 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 1 to 5 and takes 436 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 2 to 3 and takes 544 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 2 to 4 and takes 550 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 2 to 5 and takes 566 minutes to travel along.
There is a road that goes from 3 to 5 and takes 129 minutes to travel along.
Where should they hold the party, and how long will it take everyone to get there?
