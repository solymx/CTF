Our inside man in Company $x made us aware of a new DRM schem they are employing. By accident he was able to aquire the program they use to encode their data with (rev.cmp), unfortunately the decoding algorithm was out of his reach. Internal documents state, that they use a custom, highly secure, state of the art virtual machine (VM). Quickly thinking he punched a whole, with a round house kick, into the firewall to make the VM reachable from the internet. From promotional documents he also recoverd a second program, ¡¥BrainFuckInterpreter.cmp¡¦. The name speeks for itself.

Your goal
write a program that does the inverse of rev.cmp
to initialize the challenge call #252. This overwrites the first 6 memory cells in global data.
to check the solution call #253
