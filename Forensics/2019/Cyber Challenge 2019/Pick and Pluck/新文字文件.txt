We have no idea how, but we suspect a disgruntled employee has exfiltrated a recording of the blue-footed booby we are about to use in a highly anticipated bird documentary. Normally this wouldn¡¦t bother us. Problem is, we are extremely afraid of a rival production company stealing our source material. All we found was this on the desk. We don¡¦t have enough money to pay you, but you can have a front-row seat at the red carpet premier of the documentary if you help us prove the employee is guilty.
