backend_www got backup at /var/www/html.tar.gz

Hint: Try to get the binary first, figure out the way.

Notice: html.tar.gz is just a backup, IP of administrator may be changed sometimes. The xinetd config is also provided.

binary is changed a little bit, it makes your life easier:)

Hint 2: api_key helps
